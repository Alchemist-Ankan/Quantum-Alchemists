## 🧪 **For Hackathon Testing Only**

### 🔧 **Optional Debug Mode**
If judges/testers want to see the security implementation:

1. **Enable Debug Panels** (optional):
   ```typescript
   // In src/config/devConfig.ts
   SHOW_DEBUG_PANELS: true  // Temporarily for demo
   ```

2. **View Security Features**:
   - Security audit panel shows data isolation
   - Authentication debug shows user state
   - All security measures visible for evaluation

3. **Reset for Production**:
   ```typescript
   SHOW_DEBUG_PANELS: false  // Back to normal
   ```
