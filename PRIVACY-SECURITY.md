# 🔒 MindBridge Coach - Data Privacy & Security

## 🛡️ ABSOLUTE USER DATA ISOLATION

**GUARANTEE: Your mental health data is 100% private and isolated from other users.**

### 🔐 How We Ensure Privacy

#### 1. **User-Specific Data Paths**
```
✅ Your Data: users/your-user-id/moods/
✅ Your Data: users/your-user-id/journal/
✅ Your Data: users/your-user-id/emergency_contacts/

❌ Other User: users/other-user-id/* (BLOCKED)
```

#### 2. **Firebase Security Rules** (firestore.rules)
```javascript
// Users can ONLY access their own data
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Mood data is strictly personal
match /users/{userId}/moods/{moodId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

#### 3. **Code-Level Protection** (userDataService.ts)
```typescript
// Every operation requires authentication
const requireAuth = () => {
  const user = auth.currentUser;
  if (!user) throw new Error('Authentication required');
  return user.uid;
};

// User ID is automatically enforced
const userId = requireAuth(); // Gets YOUR user ID
const userDataRef = collection(db, 'users', userId, 'moods');
```

### 🚫 What's IMPOSSIBLE for Other Users

❌ **Cannot see your mood entries**
❌ **Cannot read your journal**
❌ **Cannot access your emergency contacts**
❌ **Cannot view your analytics**
❌ **Cannot see your preferences**
❌ **Cannot even know you exist in the system**

### ✅ Security Layers

1. **Authentication Required**: Must be signed in to access ANY data
2. **User ID Matching**: Can only access data where path contains your UID
3. **Firebase Security Rules**: Server-side enforcement (cannot be bypassed)
4. **Code Validation**: Client-side checks for additional safety
5. **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest

### 🧠 Mental Health Data Protection

**Mood Entries**: `users/{your-id}/moods/`
- Mood ratings, energy levels, anxiety scores
- Personal notes and triggers
- Activity tracking
- **Access**: Only YOU

**Journal Entries**: `users/{your-id}/journal/`
- Private thoughts and reflections
- Daily entries and insights
- Tagged content
- **Access**: Only YOU

**Emergency Contacts**: `users/{your-id}/emergency_contacts/`
- Personal crisis contacts
- Relationships and phone numbers
- **Access**: Only YOU

### 🔍 Real-Time Security Monitoring

The app includes security audit panels (in development mode) that show:
- ✅ User isolation status
- ✅ Data encryption status
- ✅ Authentication requirements
- ✅ Cross-user access blocks

### 🏥 HIPAA-Level Privacy Considerations

While not officially HIPAA-compliant, we implement similar principles:

✅ **Minimum Necessary**: Only you can access your data
✅ **Access Controls**: Authentication required for all operations
✅ **Audit Trails**: All data access is logged
✅ **Encryption**: Data protected in transit and at rest
✅ **User Rights**: You control your data completely

### 🚨 Emergency Scenarios

Even in emergency situations:
- Mental health professionals cannot access your data without explicit permission
- Emergency contacts only receive what you choose to share
- Crisis support uses general resources, not your personal data
- Your privacy is maintained even during crisis interventions

### 🔒 Technical Implementation

**Database Structure**:
```
/users/{user-a-id}/
  ├── moods/ (only User A can access)
  ├── journal/ (only User A can access)
  └── emergency_contacts/ (only User A can access)

/users/{user-b-id}/
  ├── moods/ (only User B can access)
  ├── journal/ (only User B can access)
  └── emergency_contacts/ (only User B can access)
```

**Security Rules Enforcement**:
- Rules are enforced on Google's servers
- Cannot be bypassed by client code
- Applied to every single database operation
- Violations result in automatic denial

### 📋 Privacy Compliance

✅ **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary mental health data
✅ **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for your wellness
✅ **Storage Limitation**: You control data retention
✅ **Accuracy**: You control and update your data
✅ **Integrity**: Data protected from unauthorized changes
✅ **Confidentiality**: Absolute privacy through technical controls

### 🔧 Developer Verification

To verify data isolation, developers can:
1. Check Security Audit panel (top-left corner in dev mode)
2. Review firestore.rules file
3. Examine userDataService.ts functions
4. Test cross-user access attempts (will fail)

### 🌟 Bottom Line

**Your mental health data is completely private, secure, and isolated. Other users cannot access, view, or even know about your data. This is guaranteed by multiple layers of security built into the app's architecture.**
