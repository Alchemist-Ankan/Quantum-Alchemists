1. **Convert your image to favicon formats:**
   - Visit https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
   - Upload your meditation image (the 3D person meditating)
   - Download the generated favicon package

2. **Replace the current favicon files:**
   - Copy `favicon.ico` to `/public/favicon.ico`
   - Copy `favicon-16x16.png` to `/public/favicon-16x16.png`
   - Copy `favicon-32x32.png` to `/public/favicon-32x32.png`
   - Copy `apple-touch-icon.png` to `/public/apple-touch-icon.png`

## Current Setup:
- The favicon links are already added to index.html
- The title includes a meditation emoji: ðŸ§˜ MindBridge Coach

- Theme color matches the app's purple color scheme

## For now:
I've created a simple SVG favicon that will display a meditation figure.
You can replace it with your custom 3D meditation image by following the steps above.
